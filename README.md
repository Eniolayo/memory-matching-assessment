## 🎮 Introduction

This Memory Matching Game is a classic card-matching game where cards are placed face down, and the player needs to turn over pairs of matching cards. The goal is to find all pairs with the minimum number of clicks.

## ✨ Features

- 16 cards (8 pairs) with random images
- Click tracking to measure performance
- Best score tracking using local storage
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Animations for card flipping
- Results screen with performance stats

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project uses several modern web technologies:

- **Next.js**: A React framework that provides features like server-side rendering and routing
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that helps catch errors early
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Jest & React Testing Library**: Tools for testing React components
- **GitHub Actions**: For continuous integration and deployment

Don't worry if you're not familiar with all of these! The README will explain the important parts.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

```
src/
├── components/     # React components
│   ├── Card/      # Card component and related files
│   ├── Board/     # Game board component
│   └── Stats/     # Statistics and score display
├── hooks/         # Custom React hooks
├── types/         # TypeScript type definitions
├── utils/         # Helper functions and game logic
└── pages/         # Next.js pages and API routes
```

## 🎲 How the Game Works

1. **Setup**: The game starts with 16 cards (8 pairs) placed face down in random positions
2. **Gameplay**:
   - Click on any card to reveal its image
   - Click on a second card to find a match
   - If the cards match, they stay face up
   - If they don't match, both cards flip face down
3. **Winning**: The game ends when all pairs are matched
4. **Scoring**: Your performance is measured by:
   - Total number of clicks
   - Time taken to complete
   - Best score is saved locally
